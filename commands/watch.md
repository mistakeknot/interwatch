# Drift Scan

Run the `doc-watch` skill in **scan** mode.

This will:
1. Load the watchables registry from `config/watchables.yaml`
2. For each watchable whose path exists in the project:
   - Evaluate all configured signals
   - Compute a drift score and confidence tier
3. Display results as a table:

```
Doc Watch — Drift Scan
────────────────────────────────────
roadmap     docs/roadmap.md        [Green|Low|Medium|High|Certain]  score: N
prd         docs/PRD.md            [Green|Low|Medium|High|Certain]  score: N
vision      docs/vision.md         [Green|Low|Medium|High|Certain]  score: N
agents-md   AGENTS.md              [Green|Low|Medium|High|Certain]  score: N
────────────────────────────────────
```

4. For Medium/High/Certain items, suggest or auto-invoke the appropriate generator

Use the Skill tool to invoke `interwatch:doc-watch` with the instruction: "Run a drift scan in scan mode."
