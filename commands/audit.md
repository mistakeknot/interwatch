# Correctness Audit

Dispatch a stranger-perspective agent to validate user-facing documentation against project reality. Complements `/interwatch:watch` (which measures freshness) with correctness checking.

## Arguments

<audit_args> #$ARGUMENTS </audit_args>

If an argument is provided, treat it as a specific doc path to audit. Otherwise, audit all eligible docs.

## Step 1: Gather Ground Truth

Run the audit pre-computation script to collect project reality:

```bash
python3 "PLUGIN_DIR/scripts/interwatch-audit.py" [--check <doc-path>]
```

Where `PLUGIN_DIR` is resolved from the interwatch plugin installation. The script outputs JSON with:
- `ground_truth` — verified facts (plugin counts, build systems, file existence, versions, prerequisites)
- `audit_prompt` — the complete prompt for the audit agent
- `doc_count` — number of docs being audited

If the script fails, report the error and stop.

## Step 2: Dispatch Audit Agent

Launch a **sonnet-tier** subagent with the audit prompt from Step 1. The agent:
- Reads each doc being audited
- Cross-references every claim against the ground truth
- Returns a JSON array of findings

```
Agent(subagent_type="Explore", model="sonnet", prompt=<audit_prompt from step 1>)
```

The agent prompt instructs it to check 8 drift classes:
1. Stale counts
2. Wrong commands
3. Broken links
4. Cross-doc consistency
5. Missing prerequisites
6. Deprecated references
7. Version/output staleness
8. Ambiguous paths

## Step 3: Present Findings

Parse the agent's JSON output. Present findings as a table:

```
Correctness Audit — Stranger Perspective
──────────────────────────────────────────────
[severity] [file]:[line_hint]
  Class: [drift_class]
  Current: [what doc says]
  Expected: [what it should say]
  Fix: [suggestion]
──────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Group by severity (high first, then medium, then low).

After the table, display summary:
```
Audit complete: N findings (H high, M medium, L low) across D docs
```

## Step 4: Offer Fixes

If high-severity findings exist, use AskUserQuestion:

> "Found N high-severity issues. Would you like to fix them?"

Options:
1. **Fix all high-severity** — Apply fix_suggestion for each high finding
2. **Fix all findings** — Apply all suggestions
3. **Review only** — Don't fix anything, just report
4. **Fix specific files** — Choose which docs to fix

If the user chooses to fix, apply the suggestions using Edit tool and report what changed.

## Step 5: Save Audit State

After the audit completes, save results to `.interwatch/last-audit.json`:

```json
{
  "audit_date": "ISO timestamp",
  "doc_count": N,
  "finding_count": N,
  "findings_by_severity": {"high": N, "medium": N, "low": N},
  "findings_by_class": {"stale_count": N, ...},
  "docs_audited": ["README.md", ...]
}
```

This allows `/interwatch:status` to show when the last correctness audit ran.
